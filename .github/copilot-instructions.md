This project is a professional student portfolio website built using the latest web technologies, including React and Vite.

The design should be clean, modern, and responsive. Use mobile-first design principles and ensure optimal readability, accessibility, and usability across devices.

**Frontend frameworks and tools:**
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- Apply **CSS Grid** or **Flexbox** for layout structure
- Use **ShadCN/UI** for pre-styled accessible components
- Optional: **Framer Motion** for elegant animations
- Optional: **Lucide Icons** for clean, scalable iconography

**Website Sections:**
- **About**: Short bio with profile image and animated intro text
- **Projects**: Grid or card layout showcasing work, with hover effects and tags
- **Skills**: Display core technologies using icons or progress bars
- **Certifications**: Section displaying completed certifications or badges, optionally using cards or a vertical timeline format. Include titles, issuing organizations, and dates.
- **Contact**: Clean contact form with floating labels and clearly styled submit button (include Gmail, LinkedIn, and a “Get in Touch” section in a separate container)

**Design Notes:**
- Follow semantic HTML and accessibility best practices (e.g., landmarks, aria-labels)
- Ensure contrast between background and font colors for readability
- Use smooth transitions and subtle animations (`ease-in-out`, fade effects, microinteractions)
- Apply a modern aesthetic: flat design, subtle shadows, glassmorphism if desired

The layout should prioritize clarity, responsiveness, and scalability. Aim for production-grade frontend code that can be cleanly deployed to modern platforms like Vercel.
