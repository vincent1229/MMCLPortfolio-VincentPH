This project is a professional student portfolio website with a vaporwave motif, built using React and Vite. Use vaporwave-inspired design elements including neon colors (#ff71ce, #b967ff, #01cdfe), soft gradients, retro 80s-inspired sans-serif or pixel fonts (e.g., "Press Start 2P", "Orbitron", or "VT323"), and grid or synthwave-style backgrounds. Ensure high visual contrast with readable text, even against bright or neon backgrounds.

The layout should be clean, responsive, and modernâ€”prefer flexbox or CSS grid for structure. Mobile-first design principles must be followed.

Preferred CSS framework: Tailwind CSS (if used, apply custom theme extension for vaporwave colors).

Website sections:
- About: Short bio with image, vaporwave background, animated intro text
- Projects: Cards or grid layout with hover effects and tags
- Skills: Neon bars or icons with animated percent indicators
- Contact: Minimal form with floating labels and synthwave-styled button

Design notes:
- Use smooth transitions and subtle animations (e.g., `ease-in-out`, `fadeIn`, or `glitch` effects)
- Embrace layering, glassmorphism, or noise textures if appropriate
- Use semantic HTML and accessibility best practices

Optional libraries:
- Framer Motion for animations
- Lucide or Phosphor icons for a stylized look
- ShadCN/ui or Radix UI for consistent and accessible components
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
